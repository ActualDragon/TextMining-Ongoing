# TextMining
Software based on text mining of electronic medical records to determine postoperative risk in patients 

Preoperative risk indices are tools that allow healthcare professional to take the necessary precautions to reduce the posibility of complications in surgical interventions. Additionally, technological advancements allow us to develop tools that assist in the work of doctors and health professionals. 
In this project, proposes the use of text mining algorithms to extract relevant information from electronic health records to automate the calculation of four preoperative risk scales: the Goldman Index, the Lee Score, the Detsky Index and the Padua Predictive Score. 

In the end, it is expected to obtain a tool that allows automating the calculation of these indices, as well as obtaining a proof of concept of the usefulness of text mining algorithms in the health sector.

The back end of the project is developed in Python, while the front-end display (so the medical professional can visualize the calculated indices) is developed in HTML and CSS.
